      "body": "Grenville Armitage suggested the following alternative to the last paragraph of Section 1:\n\n\"An implementation of FQ-PIE has been incorporated into the mainline Linux kernel as a queuing discipline (qdisc) [LINUX-FQ-PIE] and is supported by several Linux distributions. Another implementation has also been incorporated into FreeBSD [FREEBSD-FQ-PIE]. Finally, an implementation of FQ-PIE is also available in  the ns-3 network simulator [ns-3-FQ-PIE].\"\n\nThis is to make it clear that the Linux and FreeBSD implementations are independent, and ensure no-one accidentally assumes one is a port of the other.
